This repository consists of data and code used to support Generative Spatial Generalized Dissimilarity Mixed Modeling (spGDMM): an enhanced approach to modelling beta diversity

The data folder containg environmental and species data for the Panama and GCFR datasets (family and species level). The data for the SW Australia dataset is in the gdm package in R.

The folder nimble_code contains NIMBLE code for all four analysis datasets, as well as each of the nine proposed models. The script nimble_models.R contains the NIMBLE code for the nine models and has relevant comments.
